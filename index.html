            <p>I am a lover of learning. If there is a free, educational, online summit that peaks my interest or relates to my current life challenges, I am there. I am creative and thrifty. I'm a great problem solver, especially with short notice (the life of a mom). I love to solve puzzles. Math is my forte. I am optimistic, cheerful and friendly. I am an educator who loves to facilitate exploration, discovery, and collaboration in learning. I am a great listener and try to bring out the best in others. My life has not been easy, but I have the tenacity to keep pushing forward with positive, yet realistic expectations for the future. I have an amazingly supportive husband who encourages my growth and exploration. I have recently discovered an interest in designing custom products for 3D-printing. I am currently taking a course through Tech-Moms where I'm learning to code using HTML, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I love being a mom! Life is an adventure! I'm excited to see where it takes me!</p>
